# What is Async?

Async/await is a feature of Rust that allows for cooperative multitasking.
That is, using async/await and an async executor you can run code concurrently even on a single threaded cpu (like the Brain).

> [!NOTE]
> You may be farmiliar with concurrency through PROS RTOS tasks or VEXcode Events/Threads
