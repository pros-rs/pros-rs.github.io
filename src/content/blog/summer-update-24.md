The vexide team has big plans for over the summer!

# Our Plans

Over the summer, the vexide team hopes to:
1) Completely remove `pros-cli` from our tooling. To do this, we are working on a complete reimplementation of the V5 serial protocol. See [`vex-v5-serial`](https://github.com/vexide/vex-v5-serial) and [`v5d/v5ctl`](https://github.com/vexide/v5ctl).
2) Create in depth docs and tutorials for vexide. There are already some docs [here](/docs/) (in the learn page).
3) TODO add all of the plans

You can follow development through the [vexide discord server](https://discord.gg/y9mcGuQRYz), or the [vexide Github project](https://github.com/orgs/vexide/projects/1)

Just as a reminder, everyone is welcome to contribute to any of these goals, even if its not what the vexide team is focused on!

# What are we doing right now

Currently, we are working on our goal of removing pros-cli from out toolchain.
